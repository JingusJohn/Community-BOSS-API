# App

Built in either Rust or Golang

Rust would likely run SLIGHTLY faster, but at the cost of development time. Rust is an incredibly strict language, and writing it can be quite a bit slower than writing Go. Go code can be quite ugly with its style of error handling. It can also be annoying in my experience to work with JSON in Go. Serde in Rust seems easier.
