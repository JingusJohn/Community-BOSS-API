# Community-BOSS-API

Open Source software created by John (Jack) Branch and Cameron Thomas at Louisiana Tech University. This is a companion project to the [web app](https://github.com/CamJak/Boss-Integrated-Scheduler). The original web app uses an internal API, but this publicly available API serves nearly all of the same data.

## Purpose

The project serves two main purposes:

1. Enable Louisiana Tech Students to consume BOSS data in their projects. This can enable new visualization and data analysis tools for tech students for example.

2. Provide an opportunity for Tech students to learn the fundamentals of API consumption through a simple, RESTful API serving data relevant to them. We plan on creating some basic learning materials to go along side this API (interactive demos on the documentation site).

## Technologies

The project makes use of the following technologies:

- Golang with Gin Web Framework
- Astro Web Framework for Documentation
- Playwright for E2E testing of the documentation site

## About the Core Team

We're both incredibly excited to create software to improve the experience at Louisiana Tech University.

# Contributing

We as creators and leaders of the project have a vision for where we want to take the project. For this reason, the project follows an open source, semi-open commit philosophy. To contribute to the project, we advise that you join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FPnZSVAFSP) and communicate with us what improvements you wish to make to the project. This way you don't end up wasting your time solving a problem we don't agree is a problem and end up with your pull request rejected.

We welcome anyone interested in the project to the discord and are super appreciative of anyone wanting to contribute to this project. We're excited to provide tools and educational resources to Louisiana Tech University and give back to a school that's given us so much.
